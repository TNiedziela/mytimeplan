# mytimeplan

Implementation of recruitment task.
Endpoints are stored in StarController class.

As I didn't use JPA I've made a simplification of repository for stars, it only holds stars during runtime of application, after shutdown it doesn't save currently holded stars.

Code is stored in Master branch (not main)
